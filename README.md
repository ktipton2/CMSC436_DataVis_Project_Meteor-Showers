Notes:
To my group members, I am hoping to build a few .blend files that we can share as reference for our testing and development purposes.  

We'll need to make some efficiency decisions regarding the simulation early on as visual complexity can potentially cause performance issues and greatly increase render times.  As I'm unsure right now as of the total scale we are aiming for for the simulation since "the world" and "thousands of meteors a year" are fairly large goals.  

I don't want to oversell ourselves. 

We can always increase visual complexity from Blender after we've hammered out how we're going to connect the backend to Blender's simulation software.
